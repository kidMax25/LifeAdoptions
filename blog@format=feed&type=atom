Choosing to go to counseling can feel like a big decision for adoptees, but it is an important one. Almost all adoption stories will be laced with layers and variations of trauma and attachment struggles that adoptees will be forced to navigate and hopefully overcome at some point in their life. For transracial adoptees, the added component of racial differences with their families can reinforce some of these trauma and attachment struggles, which is why counseling is so valuable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
