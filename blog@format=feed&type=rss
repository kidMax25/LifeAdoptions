When people think about adoption, they typically think of closed adoption when in reality, today most adoptions have some level of openness. In fact, it is estimated that only </span><a href="http://bpar.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5% of adoptions today are closed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  When thinking about the different types of adoption, the focus should always be about what is in the best interest of the adoptee. </span></p>

			<title>Talking With Your Adoptee About Counseling</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.lifelongadoptions.com//images/caleb.png" alt="" width="520" height="355" loading="lazy"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an adoptive parent, one of the best things you can do for your adoptee is invest in and encourage counseling. Choosing to go to counseling can feel like a big decision for adoptees, but it is an important one. Almost all adoption stories will be laced with layers and variations of trauma and attachment struggles that adoptees will be forced to navigate and hopefully overcome at some point in their life. For transracial adoptees, the added component of racial differences with their families can reinforce some of these trauma and attachment struggles, which is why counseling is so valuable. </span></p>

While some children may be curious and open to talking about it, others may not be. Tailoring your approach to your adopted child’s needs is going to be necessary, as well as preparing yourself to answer questions and navigate these conversations. </span></p>
