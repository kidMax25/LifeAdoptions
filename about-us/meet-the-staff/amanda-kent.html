									<ul class=listings>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What do you do at LifeLong?</h5>
											<p class=text>When I started at LifeLong I was an Adoptive Parent
												Coordinator and then became an Assistant Director. I currently work in
												our admissions department, meeting with families that are just starting
												their adoption journey, helping to walk them through the process and
												answer their questions.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">When did you join the LifeLong team?</h5>
											<p class=text>June of 2019</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What motivates you to get up and go to work?</h5>
											<p class=text>My motivation comes from different things every day, but the
												two most important motivators are my love for adoption and the families
												I work with, as well as my family. I have four beautiful children and
												they are my driving force each and every day!</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What is your favorite inspirational, motivational,
												or positive-thinking quote?</h5>
											<p class=text>There are two quotes that I live by everyday: 1. A problem is
												a chance to do your best. 2. If it doesn't challenge you, it will never
												change you.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What's your personal connection to adoption?</h5>
											<p class=text>Adoption became something personal to me when I saw my sister
												in law struggle to grow a family the traditional way. She was able to
												grow her family through the beauty of adoption and now has two beautiful
												boys. Getting to see firsthand the struggles of expectant mothers as
												well as the challenges and obstacles of adoptive parents ignited a
												passion to want to help support families through adoption.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What advice do you have for our waiting families?
											</h5>
											<p class=text>Trust the process! There will be many unknowns and unanswered
												questions, but at the end of it all when you are holding the baby that
												was meant for your family, everything will make sense. You will realize
												in that moment the reason everything worked out the way it did.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">When are you happiest?</h5>
											<p class=text>I am the happiest when I am with my family enjoying life
												together. This is one of the reasons I am so passionate about being a
												part of helping families grow.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What are you passionate about?</h5>
											<p class=text>Besides my family, I am so passionate about helping others. I
												have always been someone who’s looked after others and wanted to help
												people rather than just helping myself. I love leading and supporting
												people as they work to achieve their goals.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What’s the greatest challenge you have had to
												overcome in your life thus far?</h5>
											<p class=text>One of the biggest challenges in my life was parenting and
												going through life without my husband for three years. While he was a
												recruiter for the U.S. Marine Corps, he worked from 6am to 10pm every
												night, seven days a week. I had to adapt to the change in our family,
												and with four kids that was not always a challenge I wanted to accept. I
												learned so much about myself throughout those three years. Not only how
												much I depended on my husband, but also how strong I was. My kids and I
												made the best of those three years as I was lucky enough to not work

												traditions, and found unique ways to sneak in time with dad when we
												could. It also fueled the fire in me to get my Psychology degree and do
												something for myself, which led me to my career with Angel Adoption.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What do you like to do on your days off?</h5>
											<p class=text>On my days off I love to make memories. Traveling with people
												I love, hiking, and anything that consists of amazing people and fun
												times of being outside.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What is one thing you cannot resist?</h5>
											<p class=text>CAKE! I cannot resist cake or cupcakes. My five-year-old
												shares this weakness as well. I do not know what it is about frosting
												and cake that I cannot resist, but if it is offered I will always say
												YES! Life is too short anyway...eat the cake, right?</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What books are at your bedside?</h5>
											<p class=text>My family devotional journal. I found an amazing book years
												ago that helps me be a more intentional wife and parent. There are so
												many quotes, activities, and reflections in this book that challenge me
												to be my best every day!</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What music is on your most-played list?</h5>
											<p class=text>If anyone actually looked at my playlist they would laugh. I
												have country, hip hop, Disney songs, Top hits and some oldies. It
												depends on what mood I am in. Do I need a song that will make me feel
												like I can take on the world? Do I want to have a sing-along with the
												kids in the car? Or do I want to just chill by the fire with some
												country songs? I love music!</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What's your favorite TV show to binge-watch?</h5>
											<p class=text>My guilty pleasure is Real Housewives. I like all the
												branches, Dallas, Beverly Hills, Orange County, etc. I do not watch much
												TV, but when I do this is what I watch.</p>
										</li>
										<li class=listing>
											<h5 class="question text">What's your favorite movie quote?</h5>
