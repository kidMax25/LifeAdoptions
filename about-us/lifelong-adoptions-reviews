My partner and I wanted a baby of course...but we also wanted the person who was granting us this gift to be taken care of on a number of different levels. We wanted their questions answered by the best of the best, someone to go to when their emotions were running high. LifeLong offered that for these women.

I requested information and heard back almost right away. I was relieved to not have adoption pushed on me but it be my choice instead. We looked at many families and found one that stood out to us. We texted and spoke on the phone. They even came and met both of us and we spent a weekend together. LifeLong truly helped us make this choice and feel good about it. I just wish more people struggling with this decision could find LifeLong. They will feel such relief and know that whatever their decision is is the right one for them.

As our marriage matured, we realized that we desired to share in the love of a family together. After two years of trying on our own, we decided to seek the help of a fertility specialist. In January of 2019, and with heavy hearts, we learned that we would not be able to have children naturally. With several options laid out in front of us, we knew immediately that adoption was the route we wanted to take. We began researching in earnest as the year moved along, and in August we knew we wanted to open our hearts and begin what we did not realize would be a whirlwind. We found Lifelong Adoptions after looking at many adoption services, what we liked most is that Lifelong wasn’t an adoption service at all, but an advocate for us. The counsel your team provided was much needed encouragement as we soon encountered some disappointment. We settled in for what we believed would be a few years of emotional challenges.</p><p>However, almost nine months to the day from learning we could not naturally become parents and just two months after we started the application process, Lifelong Adoptions connected us with our birth mother and future twins. Just five days later they were born and on the sixth day they were placed in our arms. Through tears of joy we looked back at our surprisingly short adoption process. While we held our babies, we thought about all of the signs along the way that said to us, “this was meant to be.” We would have been next in line to have twins in our families, and while we were initially looking to adopt one, our hearts were overflowing as we were now the parents of two beautiful babies. Our hard decisions nine months earlier had lead to an emotional journey to our children, supported by family and friends. At each step along the way, all things fell into place as if they were designed to happen at exactly that moment. We have finalized our adoption and have more joy than one can bear. It is fortunate we are now four. We cannot thank you enough for helping to open the door to our life as a family and for your encouragement. We are truly blessed.”</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=banner-below> </div><footer id=footer class=clearfix><div id=footer-bar></div><div id=footer-modules class=clearfix><div class=container><div class=row><div class="module footer-about-ll"><div class=module-content><div class=custom> <img class="footer-logo jspeed-img-lazyload" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyNTAiIGhlaWdodD0iNDAwIj48L3N2Zz4=" data-jspeed-lazyload=1 loading=lazy data-src=https://33t0xbnz.cdn.imgeng.in/templates/ll-new/images/logo-white.png data-srcset="/templates/ll-new/images/logo-white@2x.png 2x" alt="Newborn adoption near me - LifeLong Adoptions"> <p>As a traditional and LGBT adoption service provider, LifeLong Adoptions believes in the power and significance of family and that one can be formed in many different ways.
